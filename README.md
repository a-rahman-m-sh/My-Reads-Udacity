# Getting Started with The App 

This is Udacity React JS Nano degree Project 

## NPM Install 

start the project by typing `npm install` to install all dependencies

## NPM Start

then run the project  by `npm start`

## My Strategy

1. first of all, I turned the project into a functional app cause it is the most modern react apps convenient
2. I split all the components that were in the app file in the starting project to have a much leaner and cleaner app.
3. I fetched my books from the API
4. added Moving between shelves functionality
5. added search functionality
